Nothing is worse than re-writing the same code for every project. To make my workflow more efficient I've decided to make a website where I keep the components I use on a regular basis. For this project I will be using Balsamiq to create mockups of the UX/UI, Bulma and Gatsbyjs for the frontend, and Netlify with Netlify CMS for the backend.
