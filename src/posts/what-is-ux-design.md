Over the next few weeks I will be writing about the basics of UX Design based on the book 'UX for Beginners' by Joel Marsh. This book is split into 14 sections. My goal is to write one post per section sharing the basics of the book and what I learned along the way.

 What is UX Design?
</h2>

A common misconception about UX Design is that making thing 'pretty' is effective enough. While designing attractive interfaces is important, it's not the main point of UX. Every website, mobile app, gui etc. naturally has it's own user experience but that doesn't equate to having a good user experience. The goal of UX design is to make the user experience simple, logical, and effective for both the end user and the business. UX Designers achieve this goal by researching users, developing ideas that fulfill both user and business needs, and then building and testing those ideas while gathering data on how the process can be improved in future releases.
