Over the next few weeks I will be writing about the basics of UX Design based on the book 'UX for Beginners' by Joel Marsh. This book is split into 14 sections. My goal is to write one post per section sharing the basics of the book and what I learned along the way. 

<br/>

Let's get started...

 What is UX Design?
</h2>

A common misconception about UX Design is that making thing 'pretty' is effective enough. While designing attractive interfaces is important, it's not the main point of UX. Every website, mobile app, gui etc. naturally has it's own user experience but that doesn't equate to having a GOOD user experience. The goal of UX design is to make the user experience simple, logical, and effective for both the end user and the business. UX Designers achieve this goal by researching users, developing ideas that fulfill both user and business needs, and then building and testing those ideas while gathering data on how the process can be improved in future releases.

 The Five Main Ingredients of UX
</h2>

In the book Joel Marsh identifies "Five Main Ingredients of UX". These are five things that every UX designer needs to keep in mind while working on a project. The "Five Ingredients" are: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Let's take a quick look at some questions that can help us understand each of these ingredients.

<br>

<h3 class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
Psychology
</h3>

* What is the user's motivation to be here in the first place?
* Are you thinking of the user's wants and needs, or the your own (aka the Businesses)?
* Are you assuming they know something that they haven't learned yet?

<br>

<h3 class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
Usability
</h3>

* Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
* Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
* If the user doesn't read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?

<br>

<h3 class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
Design
</h3>

* Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
* Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
* Does the design lead the user's eyes to the right places? How do you know?

<br>

<h3 class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
Copywriting
</h3>

* Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
* Does it reduce user uncertainty/anxiety?
* Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

<br>

<h3 class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
Analysis
</h3>

* Are you using data to prove that your solution is right, or to learn the truth?
* Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
* How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
